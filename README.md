**Tic Tac Toe 2-player game**
*My _very 1st_ Web App and Javascript developement*
I made one static 5 page website before this.

-Vanilla JS- -Pure Css Stylings no Frameworks- -HTML5/CSS3-

## Future plans :
-app ai for single player(unbeatable, normal, and easy-mode)
-add api for 2 player
-clean up js code.
-restructure my functions
-convert to an app for android


*This is just a learning to code tool for me. I developed this is my first semester of college. It was literally my first attempt at JS.
*Would love some input, if you have any. I know it is not written the best. This was before I even learned about OOP concepts.
